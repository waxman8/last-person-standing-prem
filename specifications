Last Man Standing – Simple Rules
£5 entry per person
Winner takes all (no charity, no splits unless stated below)

How it works
Each gameweek, pick ONE Premier League team to WIN
If your team wins → you’re through to the next round
If your team draws or loses → you’re out

Team usage
You cannot pick the same team twice during the competition

Deadlines
Picks must be in before the first kick-off of the gameweek
No pick = you’re out

Postponed matches
If your chosen match is postponed, you’re automatically through
That team cannot be picked again later

Winning
The last remaining player wins the pot
If everyone goes out in the same week, the pot is shared between those players
